# Xcode Cloud Build Error 65 - Troubleshooting Guide

## Current Error Analysis

**Error:** `Command exited with non-zero exit-code: 65`
**Build Command:** xcodebuild archive with various parameters

Exit code 65 typically indicates:
1. **Code signing issues**
2. **Missing dependencies or build artifacts**
3. **Build configuration problems**
4. **Timeout issues during build process**

## Root Cause Analysis

Based on your error, the most likely issues are:

### 1. Build Timeout Issues
- **Problem:** npm build process taking too long (>10 minutes)
- **Solution:** Added timeout handling and retry mechanisms
- **Fix:** Extended timeouts to 15 minutes with fallback strategies

### 2. Code Signing Configuration
- **Problem:** Automatic code signing not properly configured
- **Solution:** Explicitly set DEVELOPMENT_TEAM in build settings
- **Fix:** Added team ID A43TZWNYA3 to Xcode Cloud config

### 3. Missing Build Artifacts
- **Problem:** Web build failing or not syncing to iOS project
- **Solution:** Enhanced verification steps and error handling
- **Fix:** Added multiple verification checkpoints in build process

### 4. Node.js Dependencies Issues
- **Problem:** npm ci failing or packages missing
- **Solution:** Added fallback installation methods
- **Fix:** Retry mechanism with alternative package installation

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced .xcode-cloud.yml
```yaml
# Updated build environment
environment:
  xcode: "15.4"      # Latest stable
  macos: "14.5"      # Latest stable  
  node: "20"         # Explicit Node.js version

# Enhanced build settings
build_settings:
  DEVELOPMENT_TEAM: "A43TZWNYA3"         # Your team ID
  ONLY_ACTIVE_ARCH: "NO"                 # Build all architectures
  VALID_ARCHS: "arm64"                   # iOS device architecture
  COMPILER_INDEX_STORE_ENABLE: "NO"     # Faster builds
```

### 2. Robust ci_post_clone.sh
- **Timeout handling:** 10-minute timeout for npm ci, 15-minute for build
- **Retry mechanisms:** Fallback to npm install if npm ci fails
- **Verification steps:** Check build output and iOS sync at each stage
- **Error handling:** Proper exit codes and error messages

### 3. Build Process Improvements
- **Explicit Node.js version:** Ensures consistent environment
- **Extended timeouts:** Prevents premature build cancellation
- **Verification checkpoints:** Catches issues early in build process
- **Fallback strategies:** Alternative approaches when primary methods fail

## Testing the Fixes

### Expected Build Flow:
1. **Clone repository** ✅
2. **Install Node.js dependencies** (with timeout/retry)
3. **Build React application** (with extended timeout)
4. **Sync Capacitor** (with verification)
5. **Install CocoaPods** (with retry mechanism)
6. **Archive iOS app** (with proper code signing)
7. **Upload to TestFlight** ✅

### Monitoring Points:
- Watch for timeout messages in build logs
- Verify "Build directory exists" confirmation
- Check "iOS public directory synced" message
- Monitor pod install completion
- Confirm archive creation before upload

## Alternative Solutions (If Still Failing)

### Option 1: Simplify Build Process
Remove complex build steps and use basic configuration:
```yaml
steps:
  - name: "Simple Build"
    script: |
      npm install
      npm run build
      npx cap sync ios
```

### Option 2: Local Archive Upload
Build locally and upload manually:
```bash
# Build locally
npm run build
npx cap sync ios

# Open in Xcode
npx cap open ios

# Archive manually: Product > Archive > Upload to TestFlight
```

### Option 3: GitHub Actions Alternative
Use GitHub Actions instead of Xcode Cloud:
- More control over build environment
- Better timeout handling
- Detailed logging and debugging

## Current Status After Fixes

✅ **Enhanced timeout handling** - Prevents build cancellation  
✅ **Retry mechanisms** - Handles temporary failures  
✅ **Proper code signing** - Team ID explicitly set  
✅ **Build verification** - Multiple checkpoints added  
✅ **Latest Xcode/macOS** - Using stable versions  

## Next Steps

1. **Push updated configuration** to GitHub repository
2. **Trigger new Xcode Cloud build**
3. **Monitor build logs** for timeout/retry messages
4. **Check TestFlight** for successful upload

The enhanced configuration should resolve the exit code 65 error by addressing the most common causes: timeouts, dependencies, and code signing issues.
