# Quick GitHub Upload Solution

## Immediate Solution for Repository Setup

Since Replit Git is experiencing lock issues, here's the fastest way to get your Bean Stalker app to GitHub:

### Option 1: Replit Download & GitHub Upload (Fastest)

1. **Download from Replit:**
   - Click the three dots menu (⋯) in Replit
   - Select "Download as zip"
   - Extract the zip file on your computer

2. **Upload to GitHub:**
   - Go to: https://github.com/luca0405/bs-v2
   - Click "uploading an existing file" or drag files directly
   - Select all Bean Stalker project folders and files
   - Add commit message: "Complete Bean Stalker iOS app with Xcode Cloud setup"
   - Click "Commit changes"

### Option 2: Create New Replit from GitHub

1. **Upload files to GitHub** (using Option 1 above)
2. **Create new Replit:**
   - Go to Replit dashboard
   - Click "Create Repl"
   - Select "Import from GitHub"
   - Enter: `https://github.com/luca0405/bs-v2`
   - This creates a fresh Replit with proper Git connection

### Option 3: Command Line Alternative

If you prefer command line and locks clear:

```bash
# Wait for locks to clear, then try:
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial Bean Stalker commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/luca0405/bs-v2.git
git push -u origin main
```
