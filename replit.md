# Bean Stalker - Coffee Shop PWA

## Overview

Bean Stalker is a full-stack Progressive Web Application (PWA) for a coffee shop, enabling customers to browse menus, place orders, manage credits, and receive notifications. The application supports both customer and admin interfaces with real-time order tracking and payment processing.

## System Architecture

The application follows a modern full-stack architecture with clear separation between client and server components:

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **UI Library**: Radix UI components with shadcn/ui styling
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom theme support
- **State Management**: React Context API for cart, notifications, and app state
- **Data Fetching**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **PWA Features**: Service Worker for offline support and push notifications

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js server
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Authentication**: Passport.js with local strategy and session management
- **File Handling**: Multer for image uploads
- **Payment Processing**: Square API integration

## Key Components

### Database Layer
- **Schema**: Drizzle-based schema with tables for users, menu items, orders, favorites, and push subscriptions
- **Primary Tables**:
  - `users`: User accounts with admin privileges and credit balances
  - `menuItems`: Product catalog with pricing and options
  - `orders`: Order history and status tracking
  - `menuCategories`: Organized menu sections
  - `pushSubscriptions`: Device notification endpoints

### Authentication System
- Session-based authentication with secure password hashing (scrypt)

## Data Flow

1. **User Authentication**: Users log in through the auth page, establishing a session
2. **Menu Browsing**: Real-time menu data fetched from the database with category filtering
3. **Cart Management**: Client-side cart state with persistent storage
4. **Order Processing**: Cart items converted to database orders with credit deduction
5. **Notification Delivery**: Push notifications sent on order status changes
6. **Admin Management**: Separate admin interface for menu and user management

## Deployment Strategy

The application supports multiple deployment targets:

### Web Deployment (Replit)

- Production: `npm run build` creating optimized client and server bundles
- Database: `npm run db:push` for schema synchronization
- **Platform**: Replit autoscale deployment
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 16 module
- **Port Configuration**: Internal port 5000, external port 80
- **Environment**: Node.js 20 runtime

### Mobile App Deployment (Capacitor)
- **Framework**: Capacitor for native iOS and Android apps
- **Build Process**: `npm run build` followed by `npx cap sync`
