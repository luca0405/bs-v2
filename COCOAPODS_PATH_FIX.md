# CocoaPods PATH Configuration Fix

## Issue Identified
**Problem:** CocoaPods gem installed successfully but not accessible via PATH
**Error:** `bash: line 1: pod: command not found`
**Root Cause:** gem executables installed to user directory not in system PATH

## PATH Configuration Solution

### 1. Updated Xcode Cloud Configuration
Added proper PATH configuration to `.xcode-cloud.yml`:
```bash
# Add gem bin to PATH
export PATH="$HOME/.gem/ruby/3.1.0/bin:$PATH"
export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"
```

### 2. PATH Setup for All CocoaPods Commands
Ensured PATH is exported before every pod command:
- During CocoaPods installation verification
- During pod install execution
- During pod setup repository initialization

### 3. Build Environment Compatibility
The configuration handles multiple gem installation paths:
- `$HOME/.gem/ruby/3.1.0/bin` (user installation)
- `/usr/local/bin` (system installation)
- Ruby version agnostic PATH handling

## Expected Resolution

### Before Fix:
```bash
gem install cocoapods  # ✅ Success
pod --version          # ❌ Command not found
```

### After Fix:
```bash
gem install cocoapods              # ✅ Success
export PATH="$HOME/.gem/..."       # ✅ PATH updated
pod --version                      # ✅ Version displayed
pod install                        # ✅ Dependencies installed
```

## Xcode Cloud Build Process Now

### Step 1: Web Build
- Install Node.js dependencies
- Build React application
- Sync Capacitor

### Step 2: iOS Dependencies (Enhanced)
```bash
# Install CocoaPods
gem install cocoapods --no-document

# Configure PATH
export PATH="$HOME/.gem/ruby/3.1.0/bin:$PATH"

# Verify installation
pod --version

# Setup repository
pod setup

# Install dependencies
pod install --verbose --no-repo-update
```

### Step 3: Xcode Build
- Archive using proper workspace
- Upload to TestFlight

## Local Testing
Manual verification in Replit environment:
1. ✅ CocoaPods gem installed successfully
2. ⚠️ PATH configuration required
3. ✅ Enhanced Xcode Cloud config with proper PATH

## Files Updated
- `.xcode-cloud.yml` - Added PATH configuration
- `COCOAPODS_PATH_FIX.md` - Documentation

The enhanced configuration should resolve the CocoaPods PATH issue and enable successful iOS builds in Xcode Cloud.
