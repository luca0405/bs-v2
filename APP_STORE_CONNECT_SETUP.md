## Important Notes

### Non-Consumable vs Subscription
- **Non-Consumable**: One-time purchase, permanent access
- **Auto-Renewable Subscription**: Recurring billing

Since you want AUD $69 for permanent premium access, **Non-Consumable** is correct.

### Product Status
- **Created**: Product exists but not live
- **Ready to Submit**: All info complete, needs review
- **Waiting for Review**: Submitted to Apple
- **Approved**: Ready for use in app
- **Rejected**: Needs changes before resubmission

### Testing Requirements
- Product must be **"Approved"** before sandbox testing works
- Sandbox testing requires separate Apple ID
- Production testing requires TestFlight or App Store release

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **"Product ID already exists"**: Choose different identifier
2. **"Pricing not available"**: Select Australia as base country first
3. **"Missing screenshot"**: Not required for IAP, only apps
4. **"Review rejected"**: Check review notes for specific issues

### Review Requirements
- Clear product description
- Appropriate pricing for content
- Product name matches functionality
- No misleading information

## After Approval
1. Product status changes to **"Approved"**
2. Copy your RevenueCat API key to Replit environment
3. Test purchase flow with sandbox Apple ID
4. Verify RevenueCat receives transaction data

## Next Steps After IAP Setup
1. Configure RevenueCat dashboard
2. Add `VITE_REVENUECAT_API_KEY` to environment
3. Test purchase flow in development
4. Prepare for TestFlight testing

The app code is already configured for your `com.beanstalker.member` identifier and will work immediately once the product is approved.
